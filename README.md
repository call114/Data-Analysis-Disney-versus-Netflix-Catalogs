# Data-Analysis-Disney-versus-Netflix-Catalogs
Data analysis project comparing the Disney+ and Netflix movie catalogs. Originally made as part of a Master's application for TU Dortmund.

# Included Files:
This repository includes the cleanup process of the original dataset, and manipulation scripts to explore and generate graphs. Every file is included in the repository, but to replicate the process it is only strictly required to have the original csv (MoviesOnStreamingPlatforms.csv), and to run the separate python scripts. It is imperative to run cleanup.py first in order to generate the separated csv catalogs to properly execute both explore.py and graphs.py scripts.

A report is included in PDF as part of the original purpose of this project.
